PROBLEM STATEMENT - CHESS:
You are required to create a program, which simulates an empty chessboard and the movements of three types of
chess pieces on it.
Chessboard: The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it. With 8 rows (1, 2, 3.... 8) and 8 columns (A, B, C.... H),
each cell can be uniquely identified with its cell number. This has been illustrated below:
A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1

Chess pieces:
The game of chess has 6 unique types of pieces - King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Horse and Pawn - each with their own
unique types of movements.

What you have to do:
You have to simulate the movement of the following three pieces on an empty chessboard:
1. Pawn - It can only move 1 step at a time, in the vertical forward direction.
2. King - It can only move 1 step at a time, in all 8 directions (vertical, horizontal and diagonal)
3. Queen - It can move across the board in all 8 directions.
These movements will be illustrated in the Input and Output section below.
Inputs and Outputs to your program:
● Input - The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and it’s position (cell number) on the
chessboard. E.g. Pawn, G1
● Output - Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all possible cells in which the chess piece can
move from its current position. For the above input, the output would be G2.
Examples:
● Input - King, D5
● Output - C4, C5, C6, D4, D6, E4, E5, E6
● Illustration -
B7 C7 D7 E7 F7
B6 C6 D6 E6 F6
B5 C5 D5 E5 F5
B4 C4 D4 E4 F4
B3 C3 D3 E3 F3
● Input - Queen, E4
● Output - A4, B4, C4, D4, F4, G4, H4, E1, E2, E3, E5, E6, E7, E8, A8, B7, C6, D5, F3, G2, H1, B1, C2, D3, F5, G6, H7

A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1
