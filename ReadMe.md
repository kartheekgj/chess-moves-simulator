## ChessBoard Moves Simulator

### Chessboard: 
The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it. With 8 rows (1, 2, 3.... 8) and 8 columns (A, B, C.... H), each cell can be uniquely identified with its cell number.

### Inputs and Outputs to your program:
- Input - The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and itâ€™s position (cell number) on the chessboard. E.g. Pawn, G1
- Output - Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all possible cells in which the chess piece can move from its current position. For the above input, the output would be G2.
